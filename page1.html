        <p>To my dearest Danreal,</p>
        
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
        I apologize that this is a mere beta test, but I have always wanted to learn this. It's been a few weeks since
        I've started learning coding, and I've been wanting to test and learn more as well, so I made this. However, just 
        because it's to help me study doesn't mean it's just that. I also made this with you in my mind as my motivation and
        as another way to surprise you! Next time, I'll write a handwritten letter — but for now, have this lang sa. Just 
        know that this is made with love and genuineness because I love finding new ways to surprise you no matter what.Your
        smile has always been my favorite motivation. After a year of knowing you, that never changed.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
        I love you in all ways and every way so don't hold back when being honest about yourself because I love learning about you.
        Even when we've been together for 2 months already, I still can't help but fall for you. No matter how much time passes, I 
        still constantly choose and love you. Loving you has been as easy as breathing for me and that never changed for me, after all,
        a year of constantly choosing you never felt burdening to me. That's why, don't question if you deserve it or not because you do
        deserve it. I will always make sure that you are always loved and cared for no matter the circumstances because after all, you're
        all that I have ever wanted in life.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
        To always be by your side is all that I ask for and I won't ask for anything in return. It's a wish that I have always made since 
        grade 11 and I never outgrew it, honestly. You have always made me feel something new that none have made me feel before. Even my habits
        on just admiring you silently never left me as well. The way your demeanor becomes calm when you are silently doing a task, the way your
        smile is always gentle and relaxed, and many more. I love admiring you after all but now, I can finally both admire and love you without 
        being held back anymore.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
        I don't have regrets in this relationship even when it took a year for us to finally confess, I still don't regret it. Even if we 
        were to relive our moments in Senior High, I wouldn't have changed anything because all that we went through made us connect deeply even 
        when we denied our feelings for one another. I will never regret when it comes to you, and I will always love and accept you as you are no 
        matter what. Let yourself express how you truly want to and I will be here to support you always.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
        I hope you'll enjoy the next page! It took me a while but it's all worth it because it's for you after all. They're mostly poems and an extra
        surprise!!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: right;">
            -Love, Loula
